# Smart Agriculture

# Abstract

In agricultural sector, farmers have to deal with the low prices fixed by the market. Farmerâ€™s access to markets is halted by unsatisfactory market infrastructure, and excessive regulation. Poor monitoring of the farm and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the other factors responsible.

The work brings a unified platform for all the farmers and customers where they can interact with each other to produce the required crops at right time. This efficient way of farming will help farmers monitor the status of farm, get suggestions for improving the productivity and fix their own price for the crop. The idea is to develop a Green IoT Ecosystem to raise the standard of agriculture. This integration of guiding the farmers, monitoring the farm and selling the crop at desired price is a one-of-its kind solution. No such platform is there to help the farmers in improving the production by directly interacting with the end users.

The project consists of two divisions. One division of the project is a hardware which is placed in the farm to monitor the soil parameters and environmental parameters of the farm. The hardware is programmed with the features of analyzing the status of the farm without the involvement of the farmer. The project helps the farmer to predict the growth and development of the yield so that he can predict the right time of the harvest. All the data from the hardware will be directly updated to  farmers phone through GSM module. This project will monitor the status of the farm and help in improvising the production by suggesting the use of required fertilizers, pesticides etc. The other division of the project is a software application which bridges the gap between farmers and consumers and enables them to cognize the pre and post production of the farm. The consumers will be able to see the details of the farmers and contact them.
